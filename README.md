# README

Hello!

As the next step in the AeroFS recruiting process, we'd like you to do a
take-home development exercise. This exercise should take no longer than a
couple hours for the basic requirements.

Please send us back your results within the next two weeks--if you've got
travel or something else coming up and this timetable doesn't work for you,
just let us know and we'll push that back further.

Good luck, and we hope you have fun with this!

## What files live where

/****************** Updated ********************/
/****************** Updated ********************/

* server : Three files in here app.js, jsonFileHelpers.js, fixtures/fakedata.json
  - app.js is the main server file written in Express
  - jsonFileHelpers.js is all the methods written for the callbacks in app.js
  - fixtures/fakedata.json is all the json data. I moved it here because I think it's better to have data in the server file.
* public: Files in here include: index.html, bundle.js, js(folder), style(folder), edit.jpg
  - index.html the main HTML page. It added bundle.js now because I wanted to tranpile so code.
  - bundle.js it's all the js files in js folder but just bundled up into one file(used webpack)
  - js(folder): Three files app.js, ajaxrequestHandlers.js, and appendDomHandler.js
    - app.js is the main entry file, have all the event listeners
    - ajaxrequestHandlers.js is used to handle all the ajax request(i used axios for ajax because it was promise based)
    - appendDomHandler.js is all the methods used to append elements to the DOM
  - style(folder) have the css file
  - Edit.jpg is a picture I added on the edit button
* webpack.config.js
  - used this to configure to tranpile and bundle the js files
* package.json
  - hold metadata relevant to the project

* `frontend_design_spec.md` and `backend_design_spec.md` still the same
